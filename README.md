The **Sankey Visualizer** solution pack creates a dashboard using information from the *Sankey Visualizer* Widget.

![SOC Alert Flow (Sankey) Dashboard](./docs/res/soc_overview_sankey_dashboard.png)

Information such as the following can be viewed:

**Data Flow:** Alert Source -> Alert Severity -> Alert Type -> Escalated Incident Severity

- **Alert Source**: This node represents the sources of alerts, such as FortiSIEM, FortiManager, FortiNDR and FortiAnalyzer.
- **Alert Severity**: The flow from the Alert Source node splits into different branches based on the severity of the alerts. 
- **Alert Type**: Each branch further splits based on the type of alert generated.
- **Incident Severity (Incidents Escalated from Alert)**: Finally, the flow from the Alert Type node leads to incidents that have been escalated from the alerts. These incidents are classified based on their severity.
